module ircd
:%*
:
:This module provides RFC2810...RFC2813 compatible IRC daemon with\
 multi-charset support extension (if it's enabled in config) and with\
 cyclic network scheme possibility (if it's enabled in config).
 
 Server name for the network is taken from %^nick%^ variable on the start.
 
 Available flags for %_network%_ subrecords on clients:
    k  - means this is a KILL record or quarantined server;
    d  - means this is a restricted class;
    o  - means this is an Operator;
    h  - means this is a Local Operator;
    s  - means this is a local service;
    a  - means this is a known server on that network;
    *  - means this is a hub where we have an autoconnect to.
 
 Field "hub" on server record contains mask(s) for servers that server can\
 introduce. Mask "!some.server" means wrong path (L:line analog).

function ircd
:ircd ["-"encoding] [host"/"]<1024-65535>["%%"flags]
:
:Opens listening port for IRC protocol connections. Optional %_encoding%_\
 is starting charset for client connections. Optional %_host%_ is hostname\
 on which port is listening and if omitted then listening is opened on\
 every IPv4 local address. Optional %_flags%_ are chars for mandatory\
 connection chain first links (see technical documentation for more details\
 about connection chain).

set ircd-default-class
:%* <string>
:Default class parameters string.
:This variable defines parameters for connections which are not match to\
 any other private or global client mask. It is a string which consists of\
 five numbers: maximum number of links from this [user@]host on the server,\
 maximum number of links from this [user@]host in this network, maximum\
 number of connections in this default class, ping frequency in seconds,\
 and sendQ for each client.
 Default: "2 2 100 90 1000".

set ircd-serverclass-pingf
:%* <seconds>
:Ping frequency for server links.
:This variable defines as often idle neighbour servers will be pinged to\
 check if they are alive.
 Default: 30.

set ircd-flags-first
:%* <string>
:Raw stream handling server flags.
:This variable defines which flags will be probed to apply to raw stream\
 on server link (i.e. before text parser/splitter to lines). You have to\
 include here any filter that requires raw stream - zip compression for\
 example.
 Default: "Z".

set ircd-flags-post
:%* <string>
:Text stream handling server flags.
:This variable defines which flags from PASS handshake will be probed to\
 apply to each line of IRC protocol. You have to include here any filter\
 that makes some network-specific protocol conversions to make difference\
 and compatibility with other servers in network.
 Default: "IPU".

set ircd-description-string
:%* <string>
:Server common description.
:This variable presents definition of the server which will be visible\
 across network. It should contain some geographic information.
 Default: "".

set ircd-admin-info
:%* <string>
:Server administrative info.
:This variable presents details of the institution and/or network which\
 this server belongs to.
 Default: "Not configured.".

set ircd-admin-email
:%* <string>
:Server administration e-mail.
:This variable defines electronic contact to server administration and\
 it is imperative to have it valid so users can find you in case of any\
 troubles.
 Default: "lame@lame.org".

set ircd-hold-period
:%* <seconds>
:Period of keeping nicks on hold due to network splits.
:This variable defines how long nicks will be kept unavailable after some\
 server was disconnected from network. Such unavailability is required to\
 prevent nick collisions after the server reconnect.
 Default: 900.

set ircd-motd-file
:%* /path/to/file
:Path to MOTD file.
:This variable defines where file containing MOTD for the server lies. It\
 can contain full path to the file or path relative to starting config.
 Default: "ircd.motd".

+hub
:%* server mask
:
:Allows %_server%_ to introduce other servers to us. The %_mask%_ is simple\
 pattern to filter introduced servers: if the %_server%_ introduces some\
 server that matches none of added masks then it will be unlinked for such\
 behavior.

flood-type ircd-errors
:
:
:If set then each corrected error on server link will be checked against this\
 and if too many errors happened then link will be SQUITed in that reason.
