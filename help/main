 be displayed in the %cw%n list. You can remove your "away" status by\
 typing %c%*%n command without arguments.

 You cannot boot the bot owner/runner.

   mirc   pass all as is

console
:%* [service|"*"] [flags change]
:
:Changes log mode for your dcc/telnet session. You can also change which\
 target (usually service or channel) log messages you want to see. Note that\
 target is affecting all flags, even 'm' one. If flags are prepended with\
 '+' then you have log level added and if with '-' then removed. You can\
 combine both adds and removes in one command. Valid levels are:
   m  display private msgs/ctcps/notices
   p  display public talk and ctcps for the channel/service
   n  display botnet notices
   k  display kicks/bans/topic or mode changes on the channel
