-=-=-=-=-  This file describes changes in recent releases of FoxEye  -=-=-=-=-

Changes in version 0.10 since 0.9:

- IPv6 addresses support.  You have to run configure script with option
    --enable-ipv6 to enable it.  Function Listen_Port() will listen for
    IPv4 connections on every IPv4 interface if is called with NULL as
    domain name.  To listen for both IPv4 and IPv6 use "::" name.

- The Solaris OS support revoked, works fine on 64-bit OpenSolaris 11
    (snv_105) but gmake should be used instead of make as modules can't
    be made with it.

- Merged libiconv detection with AM_ICONV macro from gettext tests, now
    path to libiconv defined with --with-libiconv-prefix option to the
    configure script works correctly.

- New '.chelp' command to show help on config/script commands.

- Works on 64-bit platforms.

- New running option '-q' (quiet) to not complain about already running
    but silently exit.  Intended to be used when ran from crontab.

- KEYWORD type bindtables are now near stackable variant of UNIQ type
    bindtables.

- Default password encription is DES now.
