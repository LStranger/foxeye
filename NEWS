Changes in version 0.10 since 0.9:

- IDN (international domain names) support.

- Optional feature (enabled by default) to not trust DNS PTR record for
    incoming connection until it have appropriate A counterpart.

- Removed '--enable-profile' from confugure script since gprof cannot
    handle code linked in runtime with dlopen().

- New module 'ircd' which is IRC protocol server (the RFC2810...RFC2813
    compliant). See included documentation for more info.

- New module 'ziplink' which adds connection chain 'Z' used for creating
    compressed links (Zlib, also used for gzip files).

- New IRC CTCP commands: OP for getting +o; HOP for getting +h; VOICE for
    getting +v on controlled channels; INVITE for inviting on invite only
    channels - all with syntax identical to Eggdrop's PRIVMSG commands.
    CTCP INVITE has little difference as we have INVITE user flag so we
    allow user to get invited if he/she has one of OP, HOP, or INVITE
    channel flag or have one of OP, HOP, or INVITE global/network flag
    but have not DENY channel flag.

- IPv6 addresses support.  You have to run configure script with option
    --enable-ipv6 to enable it.  Function Listen_Port() will listen for
    IPv4 connections on every IPv4 interface if is called with NULL as
    domain name.  To listen for both IPv4 and IPv6 use "::" name.

- The Solaris OS support revived, works fine on OpenSolaris 11 (snv_105).

- Merged libiconv detection with AM_ICONV macro from gettext tests, now
    path to libiconv which given to --with-libiconv-prefix option of the
    configure script works correctly.

- New '.chelp' command to show help on config/script commands.

- Works on 64-bit platforms.

- New running option '-q' (quiet) to not complain about already running
    but silently exit.  Intended to be used when ran from crontab.

- KEYWORD type bindtables are now near stackable variant of UNIQ type
    bindtables.

- Default password encription is DES now.
