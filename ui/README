This directory is place where you can put different user interfaces to FoxEye.

User interface (UI below) is some application that uses UI protocol defined
here and in file "ui.h" in this directory.

If there is module "ui" loaded into running FoxEye then it creates an Unix
socket which application can connect to and start to exchange packets. Each
packet contains data. If packet comes from UI to socket then it contains
some data that either is a command similar to 'direct service' or data to
send to network or client. If packet comes from socket to UI then it will
contain data to display (window open, filling, close, etc.) by application.
No handshake is required to start. As soon as application is connected to
socket, FoxEye sends windows list and data to fill each window (including
clients list, chat history and content of prompt line) so application have
no needs to care about own crash if it sends each keyboard event into the
socket - FoxEye will care about it on next connect.
