What is FoxEye?
    FoxEye is an IRC bot that is compatible (I meant:) with Eggdrop bot. Ones
  have almost identical command set and Tcl interface.

Note for SOCKS support:
    Full functionality of bot cannot be established since SOCKS does not have
  listen port support.   If you want use the bot behind the firewall you have
  ask your system adminstrator for NAT firewall. :)

4	cannot create console interface
5	cannot fork
6	bot already running
7
8	internal unrecoverable error

The bot is multithreaded but created threads may run with limitations:
1) If thread have a bot interface then IFRequest() and IFSignal() are NOT
    DETACHED part of it, so thread cannot call these functions itself.
2) If thread want to call any API that using interface address or any data
    of bot interface structure, thread must call Set_Iface() or Find_Iface()
    before that and call Unset_Iface() after.

Why SSL?
    OpenSSL is a library that does cryptographic encoding/decoding.  If you
  will use it you will have a secure connection between your bots.

Why iconv?
    Iconv is a library what make a conversion from one charset to other.
  You may need it if you have a number of different character sets in your
  botnet.
